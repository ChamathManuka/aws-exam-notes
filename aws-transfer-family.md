# AWS Transfer Family (Exam-Oriented Notes)

## What AWS Transfer Family Is
AWS Transfer Family is a **fully managed file transfer service** that enables secure file transfers **into and out of AWS storage services** using traditional file transfer protocols.

It is designed for **human-driven or partner-driven file exchanges**, especially where legacy systems or compliance requirements mandate protocols like SFTP or FTPS.

---

## Supported Protocols
AWS Transfer Family supports the following protocols:

- **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
- **FTPS**
- **FTP**
- **AS2**
- **Web browser–based uploads**

---

## Supported Storage Targets
Files transferred using AWS Transfer Family can be stored in:

- **Amazon S3**
- **Amazon EFS**

---

## Typical Use Cases (Exam & Real-World)
AWS Transfer Family is commonly used when:

- Business partners upload files via **SFTP**
- Customers push batch data securely into AWS
- Legacy systems require **SFTP/FTPS**
- Compliance mandates secure, auditable file transfers
- Organizations ingest external data into an **S3-based data lake**

This service is **not** intended for application-to-application streaming or real-time ingestion.

---

## Authentication & Authorization Models
AWS Transfer Family separates **authentication** from **authorization**, using IAM roles to enforce access control.

### 1. IAM-Based Authentication
- Each SFTP user is mapped to a **dedicated IAM role**
- The IAM role defines **exact access** to S3 buckets or prefixes
  Example: s3://company-ingest/vendor1/


This enforces:
- Least privilege
- Isolation between users
- Prevention of data leakage

---

### 2. Identity Provider (IdP) Integration
For centralized and scalable user management, AWS Transfer Family can integrate with:

- **Amazon Cognito**
- **SAML-based identity providers**
- **Custom identity providers**

With IdP integration:
- Users authenticate via the IdP
- IAM roles are dynamically assigned
- Permissions are enforced at the storage level

This is ideal for large partner ecosystems or enterprise environments.

---

## Security & Operational Benefits
AWS Transfer Family provides:

- Fully managed infrastructure (no servers to maintain)
- Native integration with IAM
- Fine-grained access control to S3/EFS
- Auditable access patterns
- High availability and scalability

---

## When AWS Transfer Family Is the Right Choice (Exam Signal)
Choose AWS Transfer Family when a question mentions:

- **SFTP / FTPS / AS2**
- **Business partners uploading files**
- **Compliance-driven secure file transfer**
- **Legacy systems**
- **Human-initiated file uploads**
- **Direct upload into S3 or EFS**

---

## When It Is NOT the Right Choice
Avoid AWS Transfer Family when:

- Low-latency or streaming ingestion is required
- Application-to-application communication is needed
- Event-driven or API-based ingestion is preferred

---

## Key Exam Takeaway
> If the question explicitly requires **SFTP or FTPS into S3/EFS**, the answer is almost always **AWS Transfer Family**.
